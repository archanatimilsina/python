#LEVEL 0
# 1. What is binary search in simple words?
# 2. Why must the array be sorted?
# 3. Explain the difference between linear search and binary search.
# 4. What is the time complexity of binary search?
# 5. Why is binary search O(log n)?
# 6. Write binary search to find a target in a sorted array.
# 7. What is the mid calculation? Why avoid `(l+r)/2`?
# 8. Explain low, high, mid variables in binary search.
# 9. What is a monotonic function?
# 10. Explain how binary search works on monotonic functions.
# 11. How do you find the first occurrence of a target?
# 12. How do you find the last occurrence of a target?
# 13. How do you find the first element greater than target?
# 14. How do you find the last element smaller than target?
# 15. Explain binary search on an answer space (example: minimize maximum)
# 16. What happens if the array is not sorted?
# 17. Explain the infinite loop issue and how to prevent it.
# 18. Why does binary search still work for duplicates with “lower bound”?
